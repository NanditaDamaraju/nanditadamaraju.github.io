This book can be a segue to so many interesting discussions that I wouldn’t even know where to begin. This is by far one of the most thought-provoking books I’ve ever read. Each section of the book has enough meat to become an entire book in itself.

The book begins with our origins from apes, admixture with other humans species and their eventual extinction. The book then proceeds to talk about the cognitive revolution that was brought about by imagined realities. This was by far the most powerful, eye opening concept discussed in the book. The ability of humans to construct imagined realities, such as myths, religions, legends was indeed revolutionary.  Humans have built up on these rudimentary constructs to create complex imagined structures that we see today, such as money, corporations, nations, ideologies etc. These imagined realities, the author argues ,enabled humans to form large social groups, something that is not seen in any other species across the planet. 

The author then proceeds to build on these imagined realities by discussing in detail their impact on humankind. The cognitive revolution was was followed by the agricultural revolution, which Yuval Noah Hararri and many others have claimed to be humanity’s biggest fraud. The author argues that agriculture is the root cause of most evils we see today. The author provides many interesting scenarios that compare the life of early farmers to foragers, to make his case against agriculture. 

The book then proceeds to discuss in detail the rise of empires, how trade evolved from empires, trade leading to the introduction of money and eventually religions. This was followed by a discussion of the scientific revolution and the forces than continue to drive it. The book discusses the early days of humanity in a great detail and picks up pace as it skims through the progress of the last few centuries. This is rather poetic as in the 2.5 million years of our existence, most of our progress was realized in the last few thousand years. The book ends on a brief commentary about where the human race is headed and if we survive, we would have the ability to play god. I would highly recommend this book to everyone!
