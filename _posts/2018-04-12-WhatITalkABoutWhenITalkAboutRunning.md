Wonderful memoir about Haruki Murakami and how running played a very pivotal role in shaping his life and career. I could relate to Murakami on so many levels, about his love for running, his penchant for solo sports, his comfort with being by himself and so much more. Anyone remotely enthusiastic about running, can appreciate the discipline Murakami harbors in his life, towards running and how that discipline transcends into his writing routine as well. The philosophical tangents Murakami slides into, while running make you think hard. My biggest takeaway from this book is my deep admiration for Murakami and other runners/triathletes who keep trying to push their limits and live life with an attitude that would border masochism to most. If nothing else, this book definitely inspired me to run more.
