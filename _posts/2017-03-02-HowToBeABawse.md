If you are familiar with her channel, her book is written in an unmistakably similar manner. Funny, witty, thoughtful. Her book repeatedly supplements old adages such as "be mindful", "be kind" and many more about improving productivity, working hard etc, with very relatable and personal anecdotes that would appeal to the younger demographic. A very entertaining read that'll get you introspecting!
