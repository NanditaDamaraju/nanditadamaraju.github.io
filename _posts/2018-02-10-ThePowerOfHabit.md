The first half about habits that pertain to an individual was very interesting and relatable. I had an issue with the second half about habits in the corporate world and social scale. The author uses the target pregnancy prediction and other familiar examples to make points that don't really stick out. The last part with the neurology of habits wasn't very impactful to me either and seemed rather misplaced. If you're looking for a book to better understand your personal habits and how you operate, I'd recommend the first half of this book.
