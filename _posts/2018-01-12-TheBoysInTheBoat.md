Brilliant read! In addition to learning an awful lot about the sport of rowing, I also learnt a lot about rowing culture in the US and sportsmanship in general. The author brilliantly narrates the long and winding road that put these 8 boys on a boat to Berlin, where they finally clinched the gold. He also beautifully describes the humble origins of all the 8 boys that made the Olympic team and how their upbringing shaped them to become the best in the country. All the landmark rowing competitions that took place in the process were described so vividly, that I almost felt like a spectator watching the shells row. And since this was set around 1936, the author also brings out the anti-Semitism of the Nazis and others around the world and how these sentiments intertwined with the 1936 olympics and sports back then. I highly recommend this to anyone whoâ€™s looking for a good read.
