I picked this up because I’ve seen the TED talk by the author with the same title and because this seemed like a short refreshing need. The very short read was as moving, if not more than the TED talk. I could empathize deeply with every story the author narrated and I’m definitely going to read this a couple of times to internalize everything she said.
