If you like the popular HBO series, Silicon Valley, this book is a very true, real and brutally honest version of the show and is totally going to be worth your while. While the author's lifestyle choices are questionable at best, his style of writing is absolutely 100% entertaining and often enlightening. As a recent inhabitant of Silicon Valley, I enjoyed this read because I have vicariously experienced different parts of the book on multiple occasions through other fellow inhabitants, in different stages of their career. The book was full of “insightful” adages that I truly enjoyed ruminating over. The book covered a plethora of subjects from the bay area culture, lifestyle, startups, venture capital, wealth and how they are all influenced by “random failure” and “obscene fortune”, rampant throughout the valley. The book did feel like a rant towards the end, when the author delves into his brief tenure at Facebook, but otherwise a great read that I would definitely recommend for every Silicon Valley resident.
