I picked this book up because it was the only book on my reading list that I could find in my local library. And I’m glad I did. This book was a mental massage, a rejuvenating read, working out all the knots and tension in the mind. As the book rightly points out, most of the world is constantly in the pursuit of self-centered “happiness” by chasing sensory pleasure, material possessions, fame, wealth, power etc and such “happiness” will always remain elusive. While this may seem obvious to some or possibly something most of us have heard on multiple occasions, it was wonderful listening to two great spiritual leaders, The Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, reiterate this philosophy through conversation and define what true lasting happiness feels like. The conversation then proceeds to discuss happiness in the larger context of the world and environment. The book ends with very touching stories from children who left their families back in Tibet, to find a safe haven and happiness in Dharamsala. Listening to two great leaders and children, who have undoubtedly faced a lot of hardships, still talk about experiencing everlasting joy, really help put things into perspective and definitely helps internalize everything written in the book. Everyone plagued by the vagaries of the modern world should give this book a read.
