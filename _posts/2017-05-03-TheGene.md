His writing has a very discernible style. He opens with a very strong anecdote. The statistician in me would quickly skim through this section without paying much attention, but it’s hard not to let his expressive style draw you into paying more attention to the anecdotal evidence than it requires. I’m going to admit, that his writing leaves a more lasting impression on me than the science he tries to convey. <br /><br />Coming to the science, the book begins with the discovery of the gene, which when stripped of the flowery language is essentially everything taught in the very beginning of a course on genetics. But he very beautifully links all the landmark experiments that were conducted back in the 19th century and describes in detail all the very logical sequence of events that led to many discoveries surrounding the principles of heredity. His description of those experiments obviously lacks scientific rigor but it would have made for a great precursor to my genetics course. The book proceeds chronologically to advance into the developments in the field of genetics and genetic engineering all the way up to the era of the Human Genome Project. The Human Genome project opened up a plethora of investigative directions. As Siddhartha Mukherjee puts it, the field of genetics transformed from “pathology to normalcy” and It no longer made sense to talk about the advancements chronologically. He then goes on talk about various ethical and moral quandaries that surround genetics and genetic-therapeutics that really got me thinking. He ends the book on a very futuristic note.<br /><br />I appreciate his books and articles because they are precursors to get you enthused about the field and read more about it. They are not scientific texts, nor does he claim them to be. He does however do a very decent job of explaining the science in pretty good detail.
