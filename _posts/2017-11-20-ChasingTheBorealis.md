I had the most amazing, serendipitous experience on my flight from Toronto to Zurich! I managed to catch a glimpse of the elusive Aurora Borealis while flying!!!!!
To be honest, spotting the aurora wasn’t entirely serendipitous. I was very well aware that the flight from Toronto to Switzerland would fly very close to the zone of maximal auroral activity. The time of the year was also perfect to see the aurora. I had hoped for exactly this to happen while I booking my 34 hour flight from San Francisco to Mumbai. But, I had barely heard of anyone ever sight an aurora on flight, so I just dismissed my hope as wishful thinking. Although, I figured I might as well be prepared in case it just so happens to be. I kept checking the predictions for the auroral activity before I boarded my flight in SF and during the layover in Toronto as well. The conditions seemed perfect. All I needed now was a window seat on the left side of the plane. It just so happened that most of the plane was empty. I picked the seat of my choice, in the rear end of the left side of the plane, so that the wing and its lights wouldn’t interfere with the view. All ingredients were in place, I just needed a little chemical X.
And boy, lucky would be an understatement to everything that I got to see on the flight. It started off as a faint misty glow on the horizon, which I quickly dismissed as fog.

But the glow became stronger, more green and was almost as high as the flight.

I immediately knew what I was looking at, and I was ECSTATIC. I almost wanted to jump out of my seat and shout to everyone, to look outside. The green lights were dancing right in front of my window! They danced all night long, all flight long! I could see the lights get fiercely strong for a few moments and then back to a faint glow and then back to the strong fiery green.

Oh what a show it was! I don’t think anything will ever beat the experience of watching the aurora from 30000 ft. It was the perfect vantage point.
I was too overwhelmed by everything I saw. But, I knew I had to capture it well, coz pics or it didn’t happen right? Just kidding! The photographer in me was already getting restless about only staring at the amazing view outside. It was quite a challenge to capture the aurora. I took my phone out first and clicked a picture. ALL BLACK.

I didn’t expect anything more from my 4 inch phone anyway. So I pulled out my DSLR and got to work. If any of you have tried taking pictures in low light or of the night sky, you would know how hard it is to get the focus right. For the first 15 minutes or so, I was struggling to get the focus right and then I realized I could use the brightest star in the sky, and just focus at that. Voila! That worked perfectly. The next challenge was the shutter speed. I had to keep the shutter open for at least a second, but because of the turbulence on flight, even 1 second was too long, everything got blurred. But finally, after playing around with various settings for a while, and by using airplane pillows and bedsheets as a contraption to substitute for a tripod, I ended up with these pictures, that were truly worth the fight!

And just when I thought this couldn’t get any better, a giant fireball, streaked across the sky, and oh so many shooting stars followed as well. I had never seen so many shooting stars even on planned trips where the sole purpose was to watch meteor showers. It was absolutely mesmerizing! After a while, I just put my camera aside and just stared outside to soak in all the wonder. I guess the stars aligned and I got really really lucky!
This will definitely go down as one of the most memorable flights I’ve EVER taken and thankfully I have some wonderful pictures to etch this flight in my memory forever.
