Daniel Keyes, the author, apparently got the idea for the book when he realized that his education was driving a wedge between him and the people he loved. This gave him the idea of writing a book about what happens when intelligence is increased. He then proceeded to write this beautiful heartbreaking story about Charlie, a man with phenylketonuria, who wants to become smarter so that people will like him more. Itâ€™s very interesting to read books about mental illnesses, more so if the afflicted is the first person. Such books bring out a very different side of the illness and suffering. This book touched me on many different levels. I highly recommend this to everyone!
