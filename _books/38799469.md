A brilliant page-turner about the scam that was Theranos. This is probably the fastest I've ever read any book. Even after reading this book, the original WSJ exposé and countless other articles defaming Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes, I find it very hard to believe that a young, bright, ambitious woman like Elizabeth Holmes failed to predict the consequences of her actions. According to the book, Elizabeth Holmes was clearly a charismatic and smart woman. It's hard to believe that she was so delusional about being able to get away with providing inaccurate blood test results. There seems to be more to this than meets the eye and I would really give Elizabeth Holmes a chance to explain herself if that ever happens. On the other hand, Sunny Balwani, the lesser known personality in the saga, Elizabeth's then romantic interest and also the company's Chief Operating Officer, seemed to be a very bad influence on Theranos and possibly Elizabeth. With his extremely caustic management style, extreme paranoia, absolute lack of medical or technical knowledge and a rather sketchy background, I think he had a very significant role to play in the entire scandal. A more significant role than the book portrays. His role is often downplayed as he was almost always behind-the-scenes and never at the forefront of all the media attention. <br /><br />Scandal aside, the book was a very entertaining read. The book does briefly talk about how a healthcare startup differs markedly from a tech startup. "Hyping your product to get funding while concealing your true progress and hoping that reality will eventually catch up to the hype continues to be tolerated in the tech industry. But it’s crucial to bear in mind that Theranos wasn’t a tech company." Theranos was always a healthcare company and bypassing strict regulations, peer review and other establishments that exist mainly to avoid such cases was a very naive move on Holmes' part. It's true that these establishments are non-ideal and rife with their own problems, but that seems to be the price to pay for ensuring safe outcomes. I commend the author, his team and all the employees who braved the gale force of the Theranos legal team, purely out of their ethical and moral responsibility to patients. As healthcare startups rise in numbers across the country, I hope they have their priorities straight and learn from episodes like these.
