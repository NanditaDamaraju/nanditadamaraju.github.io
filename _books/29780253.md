I listened to the audiobook and the narration was brilliant! I don't think reading the book would have come close to listening to the audiobook narrated by the author himself. It was hard to imagine that someone who does comedy for a living has a backstory filled with so many hardships. Hardship doesn't even begin to describe everything he faced. Especially the last chapter of the book which was riveting and sad at the same time. Prior to this book, my knowledge of apartheid was limited to history textbooks. It was very interesting to learn in great detail about apartheid and racial discrimination in South Africa with a very personal touch. Coming from someone born to a European father and African mother, Trevor's mixed origin makes the book and his experiences even more interesting. I would highly recommend listening to the audiobook!
