Smith</a><br/> My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1340950586"> 5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />


A great read about a phenomenal effort to quantify the health of the world. To actually accurately represent the health of the world in numbers is a not only daunting task, but is extremely crucial for policy makers and agencies for appropriately allocating resources. A country could be spending billions of dollars treating cancers, when lower back pain probably causes the largest burden on the population. I think this quote accurately sums up the book. “You could solve humanity’s most pressing problems, Murray believed, once you recognized them.” I am in complete awe of the efforts that led to the Global Burden of Disease Project by Chris Murray and his team at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. A highly recommended read for everyone remotely interested in healthcare, numbers and policy.
