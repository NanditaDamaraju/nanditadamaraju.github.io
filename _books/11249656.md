A brilliant brilliant read about how AIDS became an epidemic! Prior to reading this book, all I knew about AIDS and its relationship with homosexuality was that it was called GRID or Gay Related Immune Disease. I didn’t know why or how the two were related. <br /><br />This journalistic account about the initial days of the epidemic shows how AIDS and homosexuality were deeply intertwined and how science, politics, censorship and the media played an important role in this relationship. AIDS wasn’t just another public health issue, it was a very sensitive one. Telling “gays” to practice “safe sex” was seen as just another way for the heterosexual community to manifest their prejudice towards homosexuals and curtail their sexual freedom. <br /><br />The book does a wonderful job bringing out the pitfalls of the American attitude. It was very interesting to see how only America perceived this as a homosexual problem, while most other nations just looked at AIDS for what it was, a viral disease. And how ultimately it was the diagnosis of a movie star in America with AIDS and not the not the death of 6000 people before that diagnosis, that finally bought this disease to the limelight. <br /><br />It was also very interesting to learn how pivotal the media was to the spread of the disease. Because of the sensitive nature of the epidemic, the coverage by the media, whatever little, was very censored. This lack of coverage resulted in a lack of urgency on many fronts most importantly by the gay community, but also by the blood banks, government officials, university researchers and more. It was also eye opening, but not surprising to learn about politics in academia and how that thwarted the many attempts of sincere people who foresaw the bleak future for AIDS and genuinely worked towards preventing the spread of this disease. In addition to being a detailed narrative on the epidemic, the book also has some heart warming personal stories of people affected by the disease. These stories very beautifully brought out the vagaries of the afflicted population who were and weren’t suffering from AIDS. <br /><br />I also learnt a LOT about the gay rights movement in San Francisco and New York City. The predominantly gay Castro district in San Francisco, that I had visited an umpteen number of times was very very deeply affected by AIDS in the 1980s. The timeline of the disease in the book ends in 1987, with the diagnosis of Rock Husdon, the first movie star who was diagnosed with AIDS. But the disease as we know, spread exponentially in the 90s and early 2000s. I would love to read a follow-up to this book tracking the spread of this disease through various nations and cultures and how they tackled it.<br /><br />Last but not the least, I feel that the book left such a lasting impression because the author Randy Shilts was the first openly gay reporter in San Francisco and a gay rights advocate who himself was suffering from AIDS, a fact that I learnt about only after reading the epilogue. A deeply moving book, and a highly recommended read.
