Continuing the deep dive into our origins, I decided to pick up a book that tackles this topic from a perspective I associate with quite well, genetics. Insights into the field of anthropology have largely relied on fossil evidence and carbon dating. The admixture of genomics into the field of anthropology has truly provided a concrete path of human evolution. This book very neatly traces human evolution through DNA from the speciation from chimps to the admixture with other human species, our eventual emergence as the sole survivors and our rapid expansion across the planet. The author focuses quite a bit on the genetics of the north-western European population, which could be a drag for people unfamiliar with the demographics and geography of that area. Following the drag, was the story of the Havasupai village. I was ecstatic to read about the Havasupai people and their unique place in the genomics landscape, having personally visited and interacted with them. The author goes on to describe some of the landmark papers published in the field on population genomics, in a very palatable manner with a lot of humor. The author then touches upon the sensitive topics of race, intelligence, sexuality and many more and how deciphering a genetic basis for them is a futile exercise. I laud the author and this book for demystifying the often simplistic tales that popular science maintains. In his words “We perpetuate myths by clinging to these simple stories, and fail to bathe in the wondrous complexity of what it means to be a human”. The book, however, does have its flaws, from overlooking simple calculations to not addressing certain obvious shortcomings, which is why I would give it a 4/5.
