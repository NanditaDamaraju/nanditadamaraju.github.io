I love reading Oliver Sacks and reading about Oliver Sacks. I first got to know about Oliver Sacks in Insomniac City, by Billy Hayes, where he paints a vivid portrait of the kind of man Oliver Sacks was. I then read his book The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat, which had a wonderful empathetic tone towards people with peculiar abilities and disabilities. I really admire that empathetic, understanding manner in which he describes his patients. Even apparently negative phenomena such as plagiarism and scotoma were explained in a positive light in this book, from a neurological perspective. This book is a little bit of everything, from Darwin, to photography, plagiarism, scotoma, excerpts of his books interspersed with deeply personal anecdotes about his struggle with cancer and more. I’d recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Sacks. I’d probably rate it a 3.5/5.
