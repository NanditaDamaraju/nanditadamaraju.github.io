This beautifully written book is interspersed with philosophical epiphanies about life and death that really get you thinking. The book also gives you a glimpse into the life of a neurosurgeon and the medical profession in general and how people in that profession deal with all the pressures of making decisions and coping with their repercussions. It was also interesting to see how the author looks up to literature to understand life and death and finds answers in neurosurgery. I could also identify with some elements in the book about career choices. “ Putting lifestyle first is how you find a job - not a calling” he says. That line struck a real chord with me. The latter half of the book revolves around his cancer diagnosis and how he deals with it. He talks in detail about how it feels to be on the other side of the patient-doctor equation. He seemed confused about what to with the time he had remaining, especially because he didn’t know how much time he had left. Not knowing when he was going to die was probably as crippling as the disease itself. The book ends with a very touching epilogue written by his wife.
