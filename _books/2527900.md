Learning about Richard Thaler and his pioneering work on behavioral economics, was my nudge to read this book. This book was also my foray into “behavioral economics”, a field that has been the buzzword for quite some time. For someone, who has been fascinated by technology and science, the fields of economics, management, psychology and the likes have always been somewhat abstract. But I was quite captivated by this book authored by Richard Thaler, the 2017 Nobel prize winner for economics and Case Sunstein, a distinguished scholar and professor at Harvard Law. Despite the remarkable qualifications of the authors, the book was relatively easy to digest even for an econ newbie. The book starts off by introducing the concept of a nudge, or libertarian paternalism as the authors often call it. Libertarian Paternalism, is a very effective way of giving everyone the freedom to choose (libertarian), while directing them toward the most optimal choice (paternalistic). The many many brilliant examples the authors provide; from structuring items on lunch aisles, selecting insurance policies to reduce greenhouse emissions and more, really demonstrate how effective libertarian paternalism can be, as opposed to enforcing strict laws and rules. These examples really stood out because, for someone, who always thought that the solutions to the biggest problems today lie in technological innovation or strict regulation, I am actually motivated to think that there may be simpler, more effective, alternatives that are easier to implement. That was perhaps my biggest takeaway from this book. For the purposes of illustration, the book often (humorously) refers to two classes of people called “humans” who are plagued by umpteen biases, inertia and so on and “Econs” who are capable of making the most optimal choice irrespective of any other factors or effort required. I also learned that “human” inertia (a.k.a. laziness) rules! It rules everything, from personal decisions to decisions that could collectively impact an entire planet. In such cases, what the authors call good “choice architecture”, can really help improve outcomes. The book is also interspersed with humor, which definitely makes for a rich and palatable reading experience. I highly recommend this to everyone!
