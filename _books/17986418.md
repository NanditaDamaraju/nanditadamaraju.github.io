I would have given up on this book after the first 25 pages. Something about a "non-statistician" writing a book on statistics was a turn-off. The first half of the book introduces basic concepts that you would learn in statistics 101 course, with VERY familiar examples, in a language that seemed like a desperate attempt at humor. <br /><br />But the latter half of the book was a pleasant turnaround as the author moves from the introducing basic concepts to the pitfalls of those approaches. The author talks about all the different kinds of biases that could be introduced while performing even the most basic of statistical analyses, with some really interesting examples that I thoroughly enjoyed reading and ruminating on. That was probably my biggest takeaway from the book. The book also references some very interesting and important statistical experiments that make for good additional reading. <br /><br />This book would have made for a good precursor to my Statistics course back as an undergrad. I would definitely recommend this book for people who are trying to get a basic understanding of the field of statistics. For folks who are conversant with the field, this book would give you good insights into some common mistakes that you should keep in mind. For experts in the field, all the examples and points made in the book would seem redundant.
