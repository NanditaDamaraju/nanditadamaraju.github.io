Adding to the list of brilliant books that show you what mental illness looks like in the first person ( The Rosie Project, Flowers for Algernon). Eleanor Oliphant IS completely fine. Eleanor’s character was very witty and extremely logical. The small subtle ways in which she humored herself definitely brought out a laugh or two in me. I love how the main narrative is interspersed with Eleanor’s backstory. Eleanor faced a traumatic childhood. As she yearned for normal throughout her life, “normal” was far from what she experienced. The PTSD from a gruesome incident in her childhood manifests as clinical depression later on, which was addressed towards the end of the book. Definitely recommend this!
