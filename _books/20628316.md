I’d give this 6 stars if I could. For a young woman who has just ventured out into the “real world”, navigating the labyrinth of your career and life (a.k.a. Adulting) can be quite daunting. This was just the book I needed! I spent two weeks reading this relatively small book, because every line struck a chord with me and sent me into a tangential train of thought. I could relate to so many things mentioned in the book, that I had previously dismissed as a personal flaw or had even failed to notice. For example; the dreaded impostor syndrome gnawing at you from time to time, the “tiara-effect” where you wait around to be recognized for your efforts, the societal push to start focusing on family and the umpteen biases that we as women have been normalized to accept and ignore. It was a consolation to learn that I was not alone, but it was also disheartening to realize that women at large are piqued by these challenges. The book also focused a great deal on raising children and “having it all”. As a recent graduate, these are challenges I do not yet face, but being surrounded by strong women with demanding careers throughout my life, I could sympathize with every word she wrote. And even though I couldn’t personally relate to those passages, they gave me a good idea of what I should expect in the years to come. The book concludes with wonderful personal anecdotes from WOMEN AND MEN, who despite numerous challenges, have been motivated to lean in and motivate others to lean in. I would highly recommend this book to EVERY young woman out there. Since we need to change attitudes as a society, I would also recommend this book to all young men out there.
