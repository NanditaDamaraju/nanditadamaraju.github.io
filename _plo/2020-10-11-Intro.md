I'm Nandita Damaraju. I've been working at the intersection of Data Science and Biology for a little over 6 years. I am currently a Machine Learning Scientist at Inflammatix Inc, where I work on improving diagnostics for infectious diseases. Before that, I was  Data Scientist at Thermo Fisher Scientific where I built algorithms to improve the efficiency of genetics sequencers. With a Master's in CSE from Georgia Tech and Bachelor's in biotech from IIT madras, I've always been enthusiastic about exploring the intersection of these two exciting fields.
